My first mod, centered around everyone's favorite mechanic in TF2!

v0.1: Added crit color, sound, and text
v0.2: Added workshop icon
v0.3: Fixed crit sound not playing
v0.4: 
     -Crit text now color transitions like Tf2 in-game
     -Damage number now correctly listed alongside crit
     -Added non crit sound (may make toggleable in future)
     -Made crit colors/lifetime more in tune with TF2
     -Slightly lowered crit volume
v0.5:
    -Added all tf2 hit sounds to client config
    -Added config option for hit/crit sound volume
v0.6:
    -Fixed default sound not playing
    -Fixed bug when attacking many enemies at once
v0.7:
    -Made tf2 hit sound configurable (default is set to 'off')
v0.8:
    -Made client side (request)
    -May preload sounds in the future, but I don't think there will be a major performance difference either way
